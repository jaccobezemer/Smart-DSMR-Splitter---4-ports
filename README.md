# Smart DSMR P1 Splitter

Device that splits the P1 port into three individually functioning P1 ports (P2, P3 and P4).
It will let three devices communicate with the DSMR P1 port at different intervals.
In my case I use this device to connect a HomeWizard P1 meter, an Alfen EV Charger load balancer and a Sessy Meter for a Sessy Battery.
